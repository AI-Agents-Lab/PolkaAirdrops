## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

PolkaAirdrops is an AI-powered airdrop automation platform tailored for crypto projects on the Polkadot network.
Its standout feature is the integration of generative AI technology to create unique NFTs and automate their distribution using the power  AI sentiment analysis to active project ambassadors on social media, particularly Twitter.

Airdrops have proven to be a highly effective method for the marketing and promotion of crypto projects, garnering extensive reach and impact. Notable examples include the Axie Infinity airdrop in 2021, which attracted more than 2 million participants. In 2023, the chainGPT airdrop also made a significant impact, drawing in close to 1 million participants.

Our team is passionate about creating the PolkaAirdrops project because we recognize the untapped potential 
within the Polkadot ecosystem and the critical need for enhanced visibility of its projects. 
We are driven by the opportunity to leverage cutting-edge generative AI technology to bridge this gap,
fostering community engagement and attracting potential investors and users to Polkadot's innovative ecosystem.

The immense potential we see in combining the power of airdrops with the expansive reach of social networks like Twitter provides an exceptional opportunity to amplify the visibility and appeal of Polkadot projects, reaching a diverse and extensive global audience in a way that is both innovative and highly effective.

In our pursuit to realize this vision with PolkaAirdrops, we are leveraging the cutting-edge capabilities of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) for advanced natural language processing and sentiment analysis. This technology enables us to intelligently and automatically identify and reward positive social media engagements with precision. Simultaneously, we are utilizing EVM-compatible Moonbeam smart contracts to ensure seamless, secure, and cross-chain airdrop distributions. This harmonious integration of GPTs with  Moonbeam's cross-chain functionality is propelling us towards achieving our goal of elevating Polkadot projects' visibility on a global scale.

In addition, the use of AI-driven airdrops can be effectively utilized not only for general promotion in social media but also for specific purposes such as highlighting project upgrades, events, and even rewarding attendance at conferences. 
In  the last case, by offering attendances unique NFTs for their participation not only increases event visibility but also adds an element of excitement and exclusivity around attending these events.

In summary, PolkaAirdrops represents a significant step forward in the intersection of AI and blockchain technology, particularly in the realm of cryptocurrency marketing and community engagement. 


### Key Features:

* Generative AI-Driven NFT Creation: PolkaAirdrops allows to design and mint unique NFTs. These NFTs are not only visually distinctive but also embed certain characteristics or metadata that align with the crypto project's theme and ethos. This approach ensures that each NFT is exclusive and resonates with the project's branding.

* Automated Reward Distribution: The platform uses AI to analyze Twitter for posts displaying positive sentiment towards the crypto project. It identifies key active community members, categorizing them as project ambassadors. These ambassadors participanting on the airdrop will be automatically rewarded with the unique NFTs created by the AI, fostering a sense of exclusivity and belonging. 

* SnowBall Effect Project Visibility: As more individuals share positive tweets, the number of participants in the airdrop escalates, creating a snowball effect on the social network. Each new ambassador joining the campaign and contributing positive content further amplifies this momentum. Subsequently, these participating ambassadors are automatically rewarded with distinctive NFTs generated by the AI, nurturing an environment of exclusivity and community belonging. This process not only incentivizes continued positive engagement but also significantly broadens the project's reach and impact on the platform.


 

### Project Details

The integration of generative AI for automatically creating and distributing NFTs adds a novel dimension to crypto project promotions. This approach not only enhances user engagement but also elevates the perceived value and uniqueness of the project, potentially leading to higher visibility and adoption rates.

The main architecture of the project is depicted in the figure below

 ![Architecture of the PolkaAirdrops](./PolkaAirdrops_Architecture.png)

The main components are described here:

* GPT. This is the front-end component that implements the UI. It is leveraging the GPTs solution of OpenAI platform. OpenAI platform allows to design GPTs to automate the iteraction with users. Our users are defined as the projects or event managers that want to create a viral airdrop compaing on twitter, and also ambassadors and individuals that are posting tweets with the goal to propelling the project visibility. The benefit of using the UI OpenAI platform is threefold:
  * Leverages 1 billion monthly active users in OpenAI GPTs.
  * GPTs is supported in both mobile and desktop devices. 
  * OpenAI is the fastest growing company in internet today. 
  
  Our PolkaAirdops GPT allows to interact with project managers to help launching their airdrop campaing by defining the NFT to the project branding and the tweet analysis.  

* Backend server. This represents the core of the PolkaAirdrop platform. It is implemented enterely with Python. Its main functions are described below:
  * It exposes an API so the GPT can interact with the backend service to create the airdrop campaing. In this process, the airdrop project specific prompt will be stored and encrypted in the public IPFS. 
  * It uses the twitter public API to collect the ambassador tweets. 
  * It uses the propetary OpenAI GPT4 to perform the accurate sentiment analysis on the tweets and check that are related to the aridrop project.   
  * It creates the unique NFT following the prompt instructions already set up by the airdrop project. For this sake, it will use the propetary OpenAI DALLE-3 API. This unique NFT will be stored in the IPFS using the python IPFS API where we updload the NFT and obtain back the IPFS URI to mint later the NFT using the project smart contract.
  Below it is an example of the call to the DALLE-3 to generate a NFT:
      ```
        from openai import OpenAI
        client = OpenAI()

        response = client.images.generate(
          model="dall-e-3",
          prompt="project airdrop prompt",
          size="1024x1024",
          quality="standard",
          n=1,
        )
        image_url = response.data[0].url
      ```
  * It mints the particular NFT that will be rewarded to the ambassadors using the web3 python api. This api allows to mint the NFT in the Polkadot Moonbeam network. The NFT will be available for project ambassadors in their Polkadot Talisman wallet. Moreover the NFTs can also be traded in the Mintverse platform which is the world’s leading NFT aggregation marketplace, where users can easily collect and trade various types of NFT assets. Minting is performed using the new feature of dynamic NFT minting available in the project's airdrop smart contract defined below. 



* Moonbeam smart contract. This contract is a factory smart contract that creates a specific smart contract for the project airdrop allowing to mint and distribute the NFTs to the rewarded ambassadors. The project manager of the airdrop must send GLMR coins to the factory smart contract to create the propietary project NFT smart contract. 
Moonbeam is a perfect fit for our project because it allows for building cross-chain connected applications in the Polkadot ecosystem. Moonbeam powers dApps that can access users, assets, and services on any chain. Moreover Moonbeam leverage EVM complatible smart contracts programming where our team has extensive expertise. 
Here is an excerpt of the connection of the backend server to the Moonbeam smart contract.

    ```
    from web3 import Web3

    provider_rpc = {
        "development": "http://localhost:9944",
        "moonbase": "https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network",
    }
    web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(provider_rpc["moonbase"]))  

    ```



### PolkaAirdrop UI Mockups 

Our team already developed an UI mockup in the OpenAI platform for our PolkaAirdrops GPT AI. 
This is shown in the figure below.

 ![overview of GPTs in the OpenAI platform](./OpenAI_GPTs.png)


As you can see in the figure, the users will see our PolkaAirdrops GPT AI  where they can manage the Airdrop campaing and also claim the NFT airdrops. 
The PolkaAirdrop is a specific GPT that is viewed and directly accessible by billions of users worldwide that it is using the OpenAI platform. Users can install it for free in their own OpenAI platform. 


Once users have been installed the PolkaAirdrop, they will see the PolkaAirdrop UI as seen in the figure below. 

![overview of GPTs in the OpenAI platform](./OpenAI_Polka.png)

In the figure, there are shown at the bottom the user main actions that will trigger the iteraction with the PolkaAirdrop GPT AI:  
* _How do I create an airdop for my project?_. In this action the GPT AI will guide through the different steps to set up the airdrop such as defining the project manager address, the project prompt NFT, the requisites for ambassadors to get rewarded the NFT, the duration of the airdrop, and so on. 

* _Can you guide me on participation on the airdrop?_. This action is foscused to the ambassadors that the GPT AI will inform the ambassadors the actions that they have to perform to gain the NFT reward. 

* _How do I redeem the airdrop?_. This is after the ending of the airdrop campaing, ambassadors can can back here to redeempt the NFT based on their posts performed in the Twitter social network. 

* _What are the current airdrops on the Polkadot network?_. This is informative of the current ongoing airdrop that ambassadors can participate to promote the Polkadot project. 

###  PolkaAirdrop's Limitations 

* We are not intenting to trade NFTs. This is not a marketplace of NFT where anyone can sell and buy NFTs. For this purpose there are already platforms that are offering these services such as  Mintverse. 

* We are focused on NFT airdrops only. The project can be extended to support later on token-based airdrops as well using a similar architecture. However, NFT airdrops provide value benefits to respect to token-based airdrops: 
  * Early access and exclusive benefits: NFT airdrops may provide users with early access to new features, exclusive content, or other perks. This can give them a sense of privilege and make them feel more invested in the project.
  * Potential value: Users can receive valuable NFTs for free, which could potentially increase in value over time. This can be an attractive incentive for users to participate in airdrops.
  * Increased visibility and shareability. NFT airdrops are highly shareable in social network due to the visual nature of the NFT. 


* Project promotion is limited to the Twitter social network. Althoug there are multiple social newtwors available such as Youtube, and Instagram. Twitter represents a social network as large as these platform with a Monetizable Daily Active Users (mDAU) of 330 millions.
Youtube and Instagram have 129 mDAU and 330 mDAU, respectively. 
Moreover, Twitter has been used as an excellent platform for building communities around crypto projects and also 
Twitter is home to a large number of crypto influencers, who are individuals with a large following and a high level of credibility among the crypto community. 

* It is not a NFT wallet. PolkaAirdrop is not a wallet to view your NFTs. For this purpose you can use the Talisman wallet. PolkaAirdrop is only designed to automate the distribution of airdrops.


### Ecosystem Fit

*  Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

  It will be fit in the User Interface open-source Polkadot Tech Stack. 
  Our project will offer listing and managing of current Airdrops on the Polkadot ecosystem.
  
  Up to now, there is no such as solution already implemented in the Polkadot Tech Stack. 
  
  Our solution, designed to be completely open source, directly benefits Polkadot projects
  by offering them access to our AI-driven automation software stack. 
  This innovative tool is specifically crafted to significantly boost their 
  visibility on social networks, enhancing their outreach and engagement within the digital community.



*  Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

  Our target audience primarily consists of Polkadot projects aiming to extend their reach to a broader audience. Additionally, our project introduces an unparalleled solution in bridging the gap between social network influencers and ambassadors and the Polkadot project teams. This innovative merging is designed to create a mutually beneficial ecosystem where influencers and ambassadors can significantly amplify the visibility and appeal of Polkadot projects, driving engagement and adoption in the wider crypto community. Through this strategic alignment, PolkaAirdrops sets a new standard in digital marketing within the blockchain space, offering a unique and powerful tool for Polkadot projects to stand out in an increasingly competitive market.



*  What need(s) does your project meet?
  
  Our project, PolkaAirdrops, meets several critical needs in the Polkadot Tech Stack:

  * Enhanced Project Visibility: It addresses the fundamental need for increased visibility and recognition of Polkadot projects within the crowded and competitive cryptocurrency market. Currently, there is a lack of ambasadors and influencers embracing
  Polkadot projects. Our project solves this critical need by automating the crowdsourcing of project ambassadors on social media using 
  NFT airdrops.

  * Effective Community Engagement: The project provides an effective way for Polkadot projects to engage with and expand their community, particularly by connecting with influencers and ambassadors on social media platforms like Twitter. 

  * Rewarding User Participation: By integrating airdrops with social media engagement, our project fulfills the need to incentivize and reward active community participation, which is crucial for building a loyal and enthusiastic user base.


* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?

  Our project is unique in the Polkadot ecosystem. However, recently it has been launched this year (2023) a similar project that uses AI to generate NFT automatically. This project is called ChainGPT, https://www.chaingpt.org.
  This project has been successfully launched in the Ethereum network standing today a marketcap of $38 million.
  The main difference with this project is that we are automating the promotion and distribution of NFTs on social networks using AI sentiment analysis.
  In addition,  in our project, we are tapping into the vast and swiftly growing OpenAI ecosystem, leveraging its global influence and reach with the innovative Polkadot ecosystem.

## Development Status :open_book:

We have started to design and configure the PolkaAirdrops GPT, as you can see in 
the screenshots showed above and the project Github page. 
In addition, ongoing work have been also performed
in defining the overall architecture of the PolkaAirdrop platform in detail,
as you can see in this proposal.

Furthermore, we have also been researching the Polkadot Forum.
We have found two exposed 
critical  top priorities in Polkadot ecosystem which
are (1) Marketing and (2) BizDev as you can see in the following post:
https://forum.polkadot.network/t/make-polkadot-great-again/4004


These top priorities align well with the direction of our project, 
PolkaAirdrops, which is addressing these critical areas through its innovative use of AI in marketing and community engagement within the Polkadot network. 
In addition,  PolkaAirdrops is well-aligned with the business development (BizDev) 
by implementing a fee for each airdrop.
In this way, PolkaAirdrops not only ensures a sustainable revenue stream but also reinforces its role as a key player in the business development of the network using 
cutting-edge AI technologies.
